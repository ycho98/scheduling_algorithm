# scheduling_algorithm

This project is done in Operating System class. The main purpose of this program is to compare which algorithm is the most effective.<br>


This program is implementing three different kind of scheduling algorithm:<br> 1. first come first serve 
                                                                               2. shortest job first
                                                                               3. round robin
                                                                                                                           

There are two different ways of getting data:<br> 1. reading data from text file
                                                  2. generating random numbers
