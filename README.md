# scheduling_algorithm

This project is done in Operating System class. This program is implementing three different kind of scheduling algorithm:<br> 1. first come first serve 
                                                                                                                           2. shortest job first
                                                                                                                           3. round robin
                                                                                                                           
The main purpose of this program is to compare which algorithm is the most effective. <br>
There are two different ways of getting data:<br> 1. reading data from text file
                                              2. generating random numbers
